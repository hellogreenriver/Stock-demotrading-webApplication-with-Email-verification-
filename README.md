# Features

Technologies used: 
Java, Spring boot, PostgresSQL, Javascript, Vue.js, Vuetify, Git, Google recaptcha
# Note
This WebApplication can log in, register user, view stock charts, and demoTrading.

･I used SpringBoot on the back end and Vue.js on the front end.

･I used JWT authentication to ensure smooth login, which works smoothly on localhost, but my webApplication deployed on Railway can navigate to the URL to proceed after login. JWTToken stored in localStorage is not working well.

･The stock chart information is obtained from YahooFinanceAPI.

･The stock demo trading calculations are calculated with Spring Boot.

･I used Google recaptcha for preventing spam
